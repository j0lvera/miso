# Performance Impact Review

Analyze performance implications of changes:

## Database Operations
- New queries without proper indexing
- N+1 query patterns being introduced
- Large data operations without pagination

## Algorithm Changes
- Complexity increases (O(n) to O(nÂ²))
- Inefficient loops or data structures
- Missing caching opportunities

## Resource Usage
- Memory leaks or excessive allocations
- File handle management
- Network request patterns

## Scalability Concerns
- Synchronous operations that should be async
- Blocking operations in critical paths
- Resource contention issues

## Review Questions
- Do new database queries have appropriate indexes?
- Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks?
- Could this change impact system scalability?
- Are there opportunities for optimization?
