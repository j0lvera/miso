The CLI Guidelines are an open‑source effort, grounded in UNIX philosophy and revised for today’s human-first command lines  ￼. They weave together practical best practices with design principles to help developers build intuitive, robust, and composable CLI tools.

Philosophy & Design Principles:
•	Human‑First Design: Tailor your CLI primarily for human users—clear messages, intuitive syntax  ￼.
•	Simple, Composable Tools: Create focused commands that work well together via pipes, standard I/O, and structured outputs like JSON  ￼.
•	Consistency & Predictability: Follow established conventions (flags, syntax, exit codes) so users can reliably guess behavior  ￼.
•	Say Just Enough: Balance verbosity—provide useful feedback without overwhelming users  ￼.
•	Discovery & Conversation: Offer helpful --help, usage examples, error suggestions, and next‑step guidance—mirroring a conversational flow  ￼.
•	Empathy & Delight: Show users you’ve considered their needs—clear error corrections, supportive tone, even tasteful embellishments  ￼.
•	Intentional Innovation (“Chaos”): Feel free to break norms—but only when it improves usability, and do it deliberately  ￼.

Practical Guidelines:
1.	Argument Parsing: Use reliable libraries; auto-generate help, usage, and spell-check flags  ￼.
2.	Minimal Default Output: Avoid developer-centric logs—reserve detailed feedback for verbose mode  ￼.
3.	Structured Output & Paging: Provide JSON or machine-readable output modes; use pagers like less for long output streams  ￼.
4.	Error Handling: Catch errors early; rephrase in human-friendly terms with guidance (e.g., chmod suggestions)  ￼.
5.	Naming: Choose concise, lowercase, memorable command names; avoid overly generic names to prevent confusion  ￼.
6.	Distribution: Aim for single-file or minimal-dependency releases; bundle cleanly to simplify installation  ￼.
7.	Analytics: If collecting metrics, do so transparently and give users control, ideally via opt‑in flags  ￼ ￼.
